        "In NLP latest architecture is Transformer based architectures There's three types. Encoder-only models like BERT, decoder-only models like GPT and llama. There's encoder-decoder architectures as well: Encoder-decoder models can be implemented using various neural network architectures, and their names often reflect the type of network used or the specific application. Here are some key examples:\n",

        "These models are based on the Transformer architecture, which has significantly advanced the field of natural language processing.\n",
        "T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer): T5 is a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model that treats all NLP tasks as text-to-text problems. It's widely used for tasks like machine translation, summarization, and question answering.\n",
        "BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer): BART is another Transformer-based encoder-decoder model that excels at denoising sequence-to-sequence tasks. It's particularly effective for text generation and summarization.\n",
        "Pegasus (Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive Summarization): Pegasus is a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model specifically designed for abstractive summarization, where it generates summaries by focusing on key sentences extracted from the input text.\n",
        "MT5 (Massively Multilingual Text-to-Text Transformer): MT5 is a multilingual variant of T5, trained on a large corpus of text in various languages.\n",
        "FLAN-T5 (Scaling Instruction-Finetuned Language Models): FLAN-T5 is an extension of T5 that has been finetuned on a wide range of tasks and instructions to improve its generalization capabilities.\n",
        "Code-T5: This is a variant of T5 designed specifically for code understanding and generation.\n",
        "UL2 (Unifying Language Learning Paradigms): UL2 is another Transformer-based encoder-decoder model with a unified approach to language learning.\n",
        "FLAN-UL2: This is a finetuned version of UL2 with improved performance on various tasks.\n",
        "EdgeFormer: A Transformer-based encoder-decoder model designed for efficient seq2seq generation on devices with limited resources.\n",
        "2. Models Utilizing Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Specific Tasks:\n",
        "Encoder-decoder architectures can also be used as components within larger models designed for specific tasks:\n",
        "VisionEncoderDecoderModel: This model initializes an image-to-text model with a pretrained vision model (like ViT) as the encoder and a pretrained language model (like BERT or GPT2) as the decoder. This allows it to perform tasks like image captioning and optical character recognition (OCR).\n",
        "TrOCR (Transformer-based Optical Character Recognition): TrOCR is a specific instance of the VisionEncoderDecoderModel architecture, fine-tuned for OCR.\n",
        "Note: Encoder-decoder architecture is a framework, and specific implementations can vary in their internal network structure (RNN, CNN, Transformer) and pre-training objectives."
